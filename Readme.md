# Description

This serverless plugin creates certificates that you need for your custom domains in API Gateway.
Use this in your CICD flow to automatically create a certificate, create the necessary route53 recordsets to validate the certificate with Dns-Validation and finally wait until the certificate has been validated.

# Serverless Framework

This package is made for the [serverless framework](https://serverless.com).

You can install it like this:

```bash
# Install the serverless cli
npm install -g serverless

# Or, update the serverless cli from a previous version
npm update -g serverless
```

Check out their getting started guide for more information [here](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).

# Usage Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed before starting:
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm)
* [serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)  >= v1.52.0

# Usage

        npm i serverless-certificate-creator --save-dev

open serverless.yml and add the following:

        plugins:
        - serverless-certificate-creator

        ...

        custom:
            customCertificate:
                //required
                certificateName: 'abc.somedomain.io'
                //optional
                idempotencyToken: 'abcsomedomainio'
                //required if hostedZoneIds is not set, alternativly as an array
                hostedZoneNames: 'somedomain.io.' 
                //required if hostedZoneNames is not set
                hostedZoneIds: 'XXXXXXXXX'
                // optional default is false. if you set it to true you will get a new file (after executing serverless create-cert), that contains certificate info that you can use in your deploy pipeline, alternativly as an array
                writeCertInfoToFile: false 
                // optional, only used when writeCertInfoToFile is set to true. It sets the name of the file containing the cert info
                certInfoFileName: 'cert-info.yml' 
                // optional - default is us-east-1 which is required for custom api gateway domains of Type Edge (default)
                region: eu-west-1
                //optional - see SubjectAlternativeNames https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/ACM.html#requestCertificate-property
                subjectAlternativeNames : 
                    - 'www.somedomain.io'
                    - 'def.somedomain.io'
                //optional - see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/ACM.html#addTagsToCertificate-property
                //if you want to give your certificate a name that is shown in the ACM Console you can add a Tag with the key "Name"
                tags:
                    Name: 'somedomain.com'
                    Environment: 'prod'
                //optional default false. this is useful if you managed to delete your certificate but the dns validation records still exist
                rewriteRecords: false


now you can run:

        serverless create-cert

To remove the certificate and delete the CNAME recordsets from route53, run:

        serverless remove-cert

# Combine with serverless-domain-manager

If you combine this plugin with [serverless-domain-manager](https://github.com/amplify-education/serverless-domain-manager) you can automate the complete process of creating a custom domain with a certificate.
I found serverless-domain-manager very useful but i also wanted to be able to automatically create the certificate for the newly generated custom domain.


## Examples

Install the plugins:

        npm i serverless-certificate-creator --save-dev
        npm i serverless-domain-manager --save-dev

Open serverless.yml and add the following:

        plugins:
        - serverless-certificate-creator
        - serverless-domain-manager

        ...

        custom:
            customDomain:
                domainName: abc.somedomain.io
                certificateName: 'abc.somedomain.io'
                basePath: ''
                stage: ${self:provider.stage}
                createRoute53Record: true
            customCertificate:
                certificateName: 'abc.somedomain.io' //required
                idempotencyToken: 'abcsomedomainio' //optional
                hostedZoneNames: 'somedomain.io.' //required if hostedZoneIds is not set 
                hostedZoneIds: 'XXXXXXXXX' //required if hostedZoneNames is not set
                region: eu-west-1 // optional - default is us-east-1 which is required for custom api gateway domains of Type Edge (default)
                enabled: true // optional - default is true. For some stages you may not want to use certificates (and custom domains associated with it).
                rewriteRecords: false

Now you can run:

        serverless create-cert
        serverless create_domain

### Reference Certificate Arn via variableResolvers

Since version 1.2.0 of this plugin you can use the following syntax to access the certificates Arn in other plugins

        ${certificate:${self:custom.customCertificate.certificateName}:CertificateArn}

If you are on version >= 2.27.0 of serverless & have elected to use the new variable resolver: `variablesResolutionMode: 20210219`.
You must use the new supported syntax which is:

        ${certificate:${self:custom.customCertificate.certificateName}.CertificateArn}

see the serverless [docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/plugins#custom-variable-types) for more information
